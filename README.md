We created the Jejaka application project to make it easier for tourists to find out the attractions to be visited along with the culture of each tourist destination. In addition, we also use the method of tourist attraction recommendation system based on the closest location of the user. In the search for attractions we add recommendations for the nearest Lodging, Restaurant, Culture and Hospital, so that this application can provide more detailed information, provide a sense of practicality and safety to users in traveling. This application is made in detail and packaged concisely so that users can use this application easily and precisely.
